# Overview

API reference of GoodMorning Services.

In the path of where the API can be used may differ from server to server, but in this example the path would be `/api/services` - this is for making room for other non-service APIs. The path scheme should be `/api/{service name}`, such as `/api/gmt`.

The API is versioned, for `v1` it would be under `/api/services/v1`, rather than `/api/v1/services` because the services repo might be developed, and changed at a different pace from other services.
