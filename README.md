Currently just a file server, each user have their personal file storage under`/data/gm/usercontent/{userid}/`.

I don't know why would anyone want to use it, but if you do, you will have to manually create your subfolder at `/data/gm/usercontent/{userid}/your_folder/`.

Requirements:
- mongod running
- .env present
